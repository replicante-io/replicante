# The section below is for the API server configuration options.
api:
  # The interface and port to bind the API server onto.
  #
  # By default, only bind to the local interface.
  # Production environments should place an HTTPS proxy in front of the API.
  bind: '127.0.0.1:16016'


# The section below is for the logging configuration options.
logging:
  # Flush logs asynchronously.
  # 
  # Pro:
  #     Async log flushing is more efficient as logging
  #     statements are not blocked by the drain.
  # 
  # Con:
  #     If the process crashes logs in the buffer may be lost.
  #
  # Recommendation:
  #     Keep async logging enabled unless replicante is crashing
  #     and the logs don't have any indications of why.
  #
  #     Async logging may also be disabled in testing, debugging,
  #     or developing environments.
  async: true

  # The drain to send logs to.
  # This option also determines the format and destination of logs.
  #
  # Available options:
  #
  #   * 'json': prints JSON formatted logs to standard output.
  #   * 'journald': if enabled at compile time, sends logs to systemd journal.
  drain: json

  # The minimum logging level.
  #
  # Available options:
  #
  #   * 'critical'
  #   * 'error'
  #   * 'warning'
  #   * 'info'
  #   * 'debug' (only avaialbe in debug builds)
