Replicante
==========
A datastore automation system.


Organization
============
This repo homes the following:

  * All the documentation in `docs/`
    * Special mention: agent and datastore specifications in `docs/specs`.
  * Docker based playgourds for some datastores are under `playgrounds/`.


Playgrounds
===========
Playgrounds are docker and docker-compose projects that run distributed
datastores locally so that replicante can be developed and tested.

They moved to a dedicated repo: https://github.com/replicante-io/playgrounds
