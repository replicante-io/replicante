title: Node events collection
original_id: node-events

Events are currently generated by core based on state differences.
It could be interesting to generate events on the agent side as well and collect them from core.


## Challenges

  * Accuracy of events and trustworthiness of agents
  * Collection process
  * If nodes can't send events to core but wait to be polled, what is the point of events?
