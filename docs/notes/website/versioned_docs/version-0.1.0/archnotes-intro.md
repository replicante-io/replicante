This section is for description of overarching system designs,
implementation details for complex parts or areas of engineering value,
explanations of decisions and designs that may be looked upon in the future with confusion.

Overall, documents in this section revolve (not exclusively) around:

  * Explaining the current design to new/interested parties
  * Explaining the context around sub-optimal or overly complex designs for future developers
