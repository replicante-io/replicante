Introduce the concept of organisations and teams:

  * Organisations own clusters
  * Clusters must have exactly one owning organisation
  * Think of organisations in a similar way to GitHub? Or AWS Accounts?
  * Teams are groups of users within an organisation
  * Teams can't span organisations
  * Permissions are assigned to teams
  * Users can be in multiple teams
  * Start with view/admin permissions
