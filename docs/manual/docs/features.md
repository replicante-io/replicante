## Cluster discovery
A single inventory for all your servers/instances should be all that you need.

Inspired by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), Replicante uses
[cluster discovery](features-discovery.md) to know what agents it needs to manage and how
to connect to them.


## Events
Know what happens, when it happens, how the system evolved over time.
[Events](features-events.md) are how Replicante knows what is happening and you should know too.


## Introspection
Your user's data is important.
Being able to trust the software that manages you datastore is important as well.

Words are cheap, trust is not: replicante provides [introspection](features-introspection.md)
tools and integrations to let operators monitor and understand what the system is doing and why.


## WebUI
Comfortably monitor and manage clusters from your browser through the [WebUI](features-webui.md).
