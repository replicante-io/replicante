# Examples: mapping DBs to the Model
The sections below shows examples of how some popular software map onto the datastore model.


This section has two purposes:

  1. Further explain the model by example.
  2. Prevent a single use case influenceing the model and ensures it can be applied to a diverse set of datastores.


## Examples

  * [MongoDB](./mongodb.md)
  * [(TODO) Kafka](./kafka.md)
  * [(TODO) RabbitMQ](./rabbitmq.md)
  * [(TODO) Zookeeper](./zookeeper.md)
