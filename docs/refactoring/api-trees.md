# API Tress
Status: PENDING
Reason: improve API consistency and maintainability.
Bloking something: YES (introspection API and other new APIs).


## Task
Reorganise the APIs tree to allow for more sensible and maintainable approach:

  * Introduce an `/api/unstable` tree for new endpoints until they are stable.
  * Introduce constants to be used as the API tree roots.
  * Move existing endpoints around to fit the new design.


## Plan
TODO
